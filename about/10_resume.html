  <h4>Who Am I</h4><br>
  <strong>Hello!</strong>
  I'm a programmer with strong interest in system languages such as C, C++ and Rust.
  I am currently in my third-year studying Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo
  and have had three co-op's.
  My projects are hosted on
  <a href="https://github.com/BeyondSora" target="_blank">github</a>
  and I maintain this blog.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Programming</strong> is a huge part of me.
  I enjoy the process of creating things and love seeing my efforts come to fruition.
  When not working on my projects, I often read programming books and articles.
  I also subscribe to several mailing lists
  (<a href="http://coderweekly.com/" target="_blank">Coder Weekly</a> is my favourite).
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Simple and efficient</strong> code is the kind of work I strive to produce.
  Efficiency is the primary reason I'm in love with template meta-programming in C++.
  At the same time, I devote a lot of attention to code correctness.
  Attempting to achieve better efficiency at the cost of violation of the language standard
  is never a rule in my book.
  </p><br>
  <p>
  <h4>What I Am Good At</h4><br>

    <li>
    Very strong knowledge in C++

          <p>
          <strong>Graph</strong> is a program which builds simple graphs as defined
          in the graph theory section of MATH239 at the University of Waterloo.
          The program is capable of building one or more graphs
          and answer queries on the various properties of the graphs.
          </p>
          <p>
          <strong>Dot one</strong> version of the project had just been released.
          It comes with a command line interpreter.
          A gui front-end is in the planning, although
          I'm currently still deciding on which framework to use (Qt or Gtk).
          </p>
          <p>
          <strong>Contribution</strong> from anyone would be welcome.
          The project's foundation is IMHO fairly well laid out.
          Additional features to the algorithm engine and such should be very easy to implement.
          </p>

          <strong>Software Developer</strong>
          on the Avamar SAP Plug-in team, Jan 2012 - April 2012
          <ul>
            <li>
            Cross platform C++ development (Windows, Linux, HP-UX, AIX, Solaris)
            </li>
            <li>
            Worked with threads
            </li>
            <li>
            Implemented a maintenance mode for the plug-in for offline use
            if Avamar Server ever becomes unreachable
            </li>
            <li>
            Wrote python scripts to conduct code refactoring on the code base.
            </li>
            <li>
            Various other features and bug fixes.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
          This was my first time working on a team,
          first time doing code reviews,
          first time working with a large existing codebase, etc.
          Overall, I learned many things in the four months, such as that
          one can't remember all the small details and specifications
          for even five minutes after a meeting.
          So, it's best to write them down on paper.
          </p>
          <p>
          Also, never to be afraid of asking questions.
          It's okay to ask questions.
          And it's important to ask for clarification on unclear instructions.
          Much time and frustration can be saved this way.
          </p>

          <strong>What I liked about the job</strong>

          <strong>IT Support Specialist</strong>, May 2011 - Aug 2011
          <ul>
            <li>
            Built application in C# to extract data from excel documents into SQL Server
            </li>
            <li>
            Build Access modules for organizing the data needed by the auditing team
            </li>
            <li>
            Wrote Batch scripts to organize files and automate backups for the IT team
            </li>
            <li>
            Managed the Active Directory server and the internal monitoring server
            </li>
            <li>
            Troubleshot software problems for other employees and set up new computers
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
          This was my first ever job.
          Now that I look back, it was certainly an easy one.
          But nonetheless it was still quite intimidating at the beginning.
          I still remember that during the first few days,
          I would actually hesitate and wonder how I should greet my supervisor.
          </p>
          <p>
          One thing I didn't really expect at this job was that I actually was able to do
          quite a bit of development.
          The only software developer on the team had a really tight schedule on things.
          So he had me develop applications for which he didn't have the time.
          The firm was an auditing company and most work was related to database in one way
          or another.
          </p>
          <p>
          <strong>What I liked about the job</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Fresh</strong> experience (first ever job after all...)</li>
            <li><strong>Development</strong> (was unexpected since I was hired as IT Support)</li>
            <li><strong>Sushi</strong> for team lunch!</li>
