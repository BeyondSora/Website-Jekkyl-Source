Hello, I’m Jimmy Lu, a student studying software engineering at the University of Waterloo. In my free time, I like to work on various programming projects. I also enjoy reading and working out. I finally started working on this blog as I gradually started to feel a need to record how I’m coming along in work, study, and life. I hope this will be a place not only for me to look at what I have achieved, but also to better understand and improve upon myself.

I love reading all sorts of interesting programming books and articles. My two favorite topics are low level optimization in C and template meta-programming in C++. My favorite book is The C++ Programming Language.

My projects are all hosted on github. You can also view my resume at my StackOverflow Careers page.

I hope you will enjoy reading this blog. If you have any questions with regards to programming, school, or work, feel free to leave a comment or send me an email.
